# weather

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a weather app inspired by the beautiful designs made
by [Olia Gozha](https://dribbble.com/shots/4663154-)

I use Geolocator package to get live location data for both iOS and Android.
during this app i was dealing with Api to fetch data from the internet.
